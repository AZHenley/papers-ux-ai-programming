- Expectation vs. Experience: Evaluating the Usability of Code Generation Tools Powered by Large Language Models
  - Priyan Vaithilingam, Tianyi Zhang, Elena L. Glassman
  - CHI'22
  - Investigated the usability and usefulness of Copilot, a Large Language Models (LLM)-based code generation tool, and found that while it was preferred by most participants for daily programming tasks, difficulties in understanding, editing, and debugging generated code snippets hindered task-solving effectiveness, and the study provides suggestions for improvement.

- Pair programming conversations with agents vs. developers: challenges and opportunities for SE community
  - Peter Robe, Sandeep K. Kuttal, Jake AuBuchon, Jacob Hart
  - FSE'22
  - Addresses the challenges of implementing an interactive pair-programming conversational agent by conducting a Wizard of Oz study with 14 participants, creating a hierarchical classification scheme, and comparing the accuracy of transformer-based language models, with implications for using developer-developer conversations and developing conversational agents.
  - https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3540250.3549127
